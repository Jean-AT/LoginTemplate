# LoginTemplate

A simple **REST API** built for practicing **authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**.  
This project is entirely backend-focused and was developed in **JavaScript** using **Node.js** and **Express**.

It includes routes for **user registration**, **login**, **data updates**, and **protected routes** like a dashboard, all connected to a **MySQL database** for user storage and verification.  
The goal of this project is to strengthen my understanding of secure backend development and token-based authentication systems.
